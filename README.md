## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across various industries using supply chain emission data measured in kg COâ‚‚e per 2021 USD. The dataset breaks down emissions into direct emissions (without margins) and indirect supply chain emissions (margins), enabling a clearer understanding of carbon intensity at every stage of economic activity across different industries

## Goal
To evaluate and visualize the carbon footprint of different industries and identify opportunities to enhance sustainability and emission efficiency across the supply chain.

## Objectives
- Analyze the **GHG intensity** of various industries.
- Distinguish between direct and indirect emissions.
- Identify high-emission activities per dollar spent.

## Tools Used
 - Microsoft Excel

 ## KPIs
- Total Supply Chain Emission(without margins)
- Total Supply Chain Emission
- Margin Contribution
- Number of Industries
- Margins of Supply Chain
  
 ## Insights
 1. Total Supply Chain Emission Factors(with Margins) by Industries
 2. Supply Chain Emission with & without Margin
 3. Total Supply Chain Emission Factors (without margins) by Industries
 4. Top Industries with Highest Margin Contribution
 5. Average Supply Chain Emissions and Margin Impacts across Industries
 6. Margins of Supply Chain Emissions vs Without margin Contributions
